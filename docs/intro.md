Hello, my name is Luke Twardowski.

## The Many Hats I Wear

Over the years, I’ve worked as a Military Instructor, Corporate Trainer, Instructional Designer, LMS Administrator, Curriculum Developer, Technical Writer, Product Evangelist, Product Enablement Specialist, Coach, and Presenter, often wearing several of these hats at the same time.

I’ve supported organizations across wind power generation, telecommunications, AI, safety, and government, working in both permanent and consulting roles. My experience spans learning and development, technical training, sales enablement, and coaching.

Today, I specialize in building and leading learning programs and enablement functions from the ground up. Creating scalable training ecosystems that align with business goals and drive measurable performance improvement.
