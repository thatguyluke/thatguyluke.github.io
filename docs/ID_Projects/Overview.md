# Some typical things I do

I suppose you are wondering some things.

#### All My Hats
Over the years, I have been Military Instructor, Corporate Trainer, Instructional Designer, LMS Administrator, Curriculum Developmer, Technical Writer, Product Evangalist, Sales Enablement Specialist, Coach, Confidant, Friend, Cleaner of Messes, Maker of Messes, Presenter, Demo-er, and more.  

Having worked in numerous industries *(Windpower Generation, Telecommunications, AI, Safety, Government, and others)* in either a permanant or consultant role while doing all types of training activites *(L&D, Technical, Sales Enablment, and Coaching)* I now specialize in building and running learning programs or oranizations from the ground up.

#### Curiosity and Tinkering 
I have been blessed (or cursed) to be chronic tinkerer, lover of puzzles, and a "lifelong learner" (or so I am told).  I cant help it honestly, I was born curious and have yet to give up the habit. 

This section is a collection of my tinkerings - some professional and many "just because."  I figured I would collect these bits and bobs of things I've made and put them in one easy to gt to location.  I have decided to call this location "Projects" because I am not only a curious, life long learning, chronically tinkering, lover of puzzles but I am also fantastic when it comes to giving things names.

I hope you enjoy checking some of my projects out, as much as I enjoyed putting them together.
