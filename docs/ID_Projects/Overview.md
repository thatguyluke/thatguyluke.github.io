# Overview

## I learn by building

These projects are a mix of professional work and curiosity-driven experiments, but they all share the same thread: solving problems, testing ideas, and finding better ways to help people learn and perform.

This is where strategy meets tinkering and where concepts turn into practical tools, systems, and experiences.

## Curiosity, Tinkering, and Continuous Learning

I’m a lifelong learner and a natural tinkerer. I love solving problems, experimenting with new tools, and figuring out better ways to make learning more effective and engaging.

This section is a collection of those explorations, some professional, many driven purely by curiosity. Together, they reflect how I think: hands-on, iterative, and always learning.

Welcome to my projects, a home for the ideas I’ve built, tested, and brought to life.

### Even My Portfolio is a Project

*Even this Portfolio is a project in a way.*

Previously, even though I was the head of all Product Enablement efforts (**Training and Technical Documentation Manager** with a team of 8 fantastic folks), I often filled the role of Technical Writer (when no one on my team was available) for smaller products and tools, and instructional designer/trainer for all products and tools (**Player/Coach!**)

I have been using Docusaurus for online documentation since 2018 and decided to maintain my own portfolio using it as well.  This side project helps me keep my skills relevant, practice good git habits, and continue to learn.
