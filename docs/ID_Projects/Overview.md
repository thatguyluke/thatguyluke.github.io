# I learn by building

These projects are a mix of professional work and curiosity-driven experiments, but they all share the same thread: solving problems, testing ideas, and finding better ways to help people learn and perform.

This is where strategy meets tinkering and where concepts turn into practical tools, systems, and experiences.

## Curiosity, Tinkering, and Continuous Learning

I’m a lifelong learner and a natural tinkerer. I love solving problems, experimenting with new tools, and figuring out better ways to make learning more effective and engaging.

This section is a collection of those explorations, some professional, many driven purely by curiosity. Together, they reflect how I think: hands-on, iterative, and always learning.

Welcome to my projects, a home for the ideas I’ve built, tested, and brought to life.
