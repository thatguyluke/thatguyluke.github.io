# Product Demonstrations

I greatly enjoy demoing products to customers and internal audiences.  Here are a few examples of Product Demonstrations I have done over the years.

## SAMPLE - CognitiveScale and Red Hat Openshift Certifai Intro and overview Presentation ODSC East

On 4/15/2020 I was invited to speak at ODSC (Open Data Science Conference) East in a partnership with RedHat and CognitiveScale.  My focus was a discussion about designing and deploying trustworthy models with Red Hat and CognitiveScales Cortex Certifai.  Here I walked thousands of workshop attendees through Cortex Certifai and shared a small clip of our training content with them.

*The goal:*
Educate business and ML/IT teams on the value and risks to businesses, Experiment and learn with Certifai Trial version, Scale by extending existing Governance, Risk and Compliance and Model risk management processes with Trusted AI.
