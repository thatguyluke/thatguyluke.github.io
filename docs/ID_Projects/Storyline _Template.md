# Simple Storyline Template

Templates accelerate eLearning program development.  

I made (and have used) this Storyline template (along with a style guide, and asset repository) for use on simple projects with multiple Instructional Designers and Courseware Developers.  This helped speed up the development process and storyboard generation (I developed the content following the ADDIE model and implemented an Agile Kanban board for tracking).  

Thank you for taking a moment to check it out.
