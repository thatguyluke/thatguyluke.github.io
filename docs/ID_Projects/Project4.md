# Instructional Design Projects

## AI Platform Enablement Program

From 2018 to 2022 I had the pleasure of bringing to life a full scope, award winning training program consisting of over **100** elearning microlearning modules, **2** four-day instructor-led classes, a certification program with **3** certification levels, and a comprehensive customer enablement program.  

I was initially brought in as an instructional designer to lead the design of, build, and ultimately guide the development of all course materials **(ILT and eLearning)**.  As a player coach I defined the vision of the program, built lab exercises (in Python), built individual elearning modules, and taught customer and new hire courses on our products. 

Due to the success of the program I was promoted to Program Manager and later Director of Training and Enablement.  I am proud to present the following samples of the modules and training:

### Introduction to Cortex Skills

Cortex was the primary orchestration and deployment platform designed to put ML projects into production faster at scale.  Cortex Skills were discrete reusable building blocks of Agents (tailored workflows) designed to reduce time to value.  

This module introduced learners to the key concepts of Skills and their primary use.

A centralized storyboard was used to coordinate with SMEs, the business, and ensure stakeholders had an up to date clear understanding of what the modules contained.
