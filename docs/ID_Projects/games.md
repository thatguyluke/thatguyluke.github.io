# Games

## Why Learning Games Matter

Learning games drive deeper understanding, increase retention, and promote behavior change by engaging learners in active, meaningful experiences.

Well-designed learning games create active participation, not passive consumption. Instead of simply receiving information, learners make decisions, test strategies, experience consequences, and apply knowledge in context. This mirrors how people actually build skills in the real world.

### Games also tap into key drivers of effective learning

* Motivation through challenge and progress – Clear goals, feedback, and a sense of advancement keep learners invested.
* Safe failure – Learners can experiment, make mistakes, and adjust without real-world risk, accelerating mastery.
* Contextual practice – Scenarios and simulations situate knowledge inside realistic decision-making environments.
* Immediate feedback – Players see the results of their choices right away, reinforcing learning loops.

### For Organizations

Learning games bridge the knowing-doing gap by improving skill transfer, supporting real-world application, and enhancing measurable performance outcomes.

* Complex decision-making
* Process training
* Sales and customer interactions
* Leadership and soft skills
* Systems thinking and troubleshooting

Blending instructional design and game mechanics makes learning memorable, measurable, and aligned with real-world performance.
